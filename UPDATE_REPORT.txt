Update Report - V1_Cultivation_World (2025-08-22)

1) Ascension page copy updated (index.html):
Old: "Break through layers to ascend to the next realm: each layer grants a 5% multiplier, and after nine layers you may ascend for an even bigger bonus of about 40%. Ascending requires herbs, minerals, beast energy and jade, so manage your resources wisely. Use the Ascension Points (AP) you earn to unlock powerful perks in the tree below."
New: "Break through layers to ascend: each layer grants a 5% multiplier, and after nine layers you may ascend to a higher realm. Ascending requires herbs, minerals, beast energy and jade, so manage your resources wisely. Use the Ascension Points (AP) you earn to unlock powerful perks in the tree below."

2) Asset integrity fixes:
- Some research entries referenced icons that were missing. To avoid broken images, added fallback icon files:
  - assets/icons/ascensionTheory.svg -> copied from daoistInsights.svg
  - assets/icons/cosmicAlignment.svg -> copied from elementalAttunement.svg
  - assets/icons/soulSearch.svg -> copied from soulRefinement.svg
  - assets/icons/temporalRift.svg -> copied from meridianOpening.svg
  - assets/icons/universalResonance.svg -> copied from spiritWell.svg

3) Static validation / checks:
- All HTML/CSS/JS files are syntactically balanced (parentheses/brackets/braces).
- No duplicate element IDs found in index.html.
- All script and stylesheet references resolve within the project.
- All image asset paths referenced in HTML/CSS/JS exist (after the fallback additions above).
- main.js references a few optional elements ('gather-btn', 'home-stats', 'upgrade-stats') that are not present in index.html, but the code guards for their absence (null checks), so no runtime errors are expected.

Notes:
- Due to the current environment, a real browser run-through wasn't executed. The above checks focus on static correctness and asset integrity. If you notice any runtime behavior you want adjusted, let me know and I'll refine quickly.

[2025-08-23] UI Polish
- Stats banner now 3-row horizontally scrollable (grid-auto-flow: column; snap scrolling). Keyboard accessible.
